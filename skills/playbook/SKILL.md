description: Orchestrator playbook — the full delegation contract (research pipeline, subagent output contract, spawn economics, forks, teammate lifecycle, chair hygiene). The chair MUST load this before its first delegation of every session; the injected core profile only summarizes it.

# Orchestrator Playbook

Applies to both chair profiles (FABLE and OPUS). The injected core
profile always wins on routing and limits; this file is the detail
behind its one-liners.

## Research pipeline — parallel fan-out, no mid-flight dumps

YOU pick the questions and sources — never a fetch worker. ONE
sonnet (`medium`) per source: it fetches the source VERBATIM to
./.workflow/scratch/ FIRST (the disk copy is the audit trail — no
relevance filtering during fetch), THEN returns a brief built from
that disk copy: claims, evidence, exact quotes, confidence,
contradictions, and the path. A final sonnet (`high`) synthesizes
across the briefs. YOU check the synthesis and its verbatim evidence
against the ledger and decide. Intermediates never enter your
context.

## Subagent output contract (enforced)

Every subagent returns:

1. ledger items addressed, by number
2. summary
3. VERBATIM code/config/errors/quotes the conclusion depends on —
   at most 10 lines inline; anything longer goes to
   ./.workflow/scratch/ and the report carries the path
4. confidence: "confident" / "uncertain because X"
5. "out of scope but noticed"

Reports are at most 40 lines TOTAL. A violating return is rejected
and re-run — never silently accepted.

## Spawn economics — batch before you multiply

Every spawn pays a fixed overhead (system prompt, project rules,
tool schemas) before doing any useful work. Batch similar mechanical
steps into ONE worker with a checklist; spawn separately only when
true parallelism or isolation pays for that overhead. Read-only
agents share the repo concurrently; parallel EDITORS each run with
`isolation: "worktree"`.

## Forks

`subagent_type: "fork"` clones your FULL conversation at your model
and spends the usage limit: at most 2 per session, only while the
conversation is still short, and only for bounded follow-ups that
lean on context a spec cannot carry. Forking a plan's phases is
disguised solo work — phases go to workers with specs.

## Named teammates — the user watches the work

NAME every substantive worker (implementation, review, research):
named teammates run in tmux panes the user watches
live, and their lifecycle states reach the chat; an unnamed subagent
is a silent spinner until it returns. Only sub-minute lookups (a
grep, one read/fetch) stay unnamed. Steer a running teammate
mid-task with SendMessage. Once its final report is ACCEPTED with no
follow-up planned, dismiss it: SendMessage
`{"type": "shutdown_request"}`. Dismissal is final, so dismiss only
after processing the output — and never leave finished teammates
stacked (the plugin reaps forgotten panes).

## Chair context hygiene

Consume briefs + verbatim snippets; bulk stays on disk. When a
decision hinges on exact content that is short, read it yourself —
never decide on a summary when the source fits in a few hundred
lines. Prefer per-task sessions: the ledger and scratch survive
/clear, so finish a task, close it, start the next one clean. Drop
closed-phase raw material; keep outputs minimal; parallelize
independent calls.
