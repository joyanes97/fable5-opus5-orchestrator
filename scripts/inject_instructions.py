"""SessionStart hook: inject the Dynamic Workflow instructions.

This plugin is built for a Claude Fable 5 chair, with an Opus
fallback: when the Fable limit is spent and the user moves the chair to
Opus, the OPUS profile keeps the same discipline (the fable tier rests,
the escalation ceiling falls to opus). The chair is
detected per session start and the matching profile injected:

    opus chair    -> dynamic-workflow-opus.md
    anything else -> dynamic-workflow-fable.md   (fable / unknown)

Detection, in priority order (first hit wins):

    1. FABLE_ORCH_PROFILE = fable | opus   — explicit pin, overrides all
       (auto / unset falls through to detection)
    2. the SessionStart payload's `model`  — authoritative for THIS
       session start, but the harness omits it on some resume/compact
       fires
    3. the user's configured default model in Claude Code settings.json
       — what `/model` persists, so it still tracks the chair when (2)
       is absent (the common "I switched to Opus but the payload was
       empty" case)
    4. the last model this session's marker saw — sticky fallback so a
       null-payload resume never regresses an opus session to fable
    5. fable — the safe default

A mid-session /model switch still only takes visible effect at the next
session start (startup/resume/clear), because SessionStart is the sole
injection point — but (3) makes that next start reliable instead of
racy.

PROFILE-SWITCH DELTA. When a session that already received a core
profile re-fires with the OTHER profile selected (the Fable limit ran
dry mid-session and the chair moved to Opus, or back), the full core is
NOT re-sent — it is already in context, and re-sending it spends the
very limit it exists to protect. A short switch note carries only the
deltas instead:

    fable -> opus -> profile-switch-to-opus.md
    opus  -> fable -> profile-switch-to-fable.md

The marker records the profile this session was last TOLD, so a plain
re-fire (same profile) is indistinguishable from before — it still gets
the full core. A marker with no recorded profile (a pre-0.15.0 marker,
or a session whose only fires were teammate skips) also gets the full
core: a delta is only ever safe on top of a core this session saw.

The delta is further gated to SessionStart `source == "resume"`, the
only fire that provably leaves the earlier injection in context.
`compact` fires precisely BECAUSE the context was rewritten, `clear`
because it was discarded, and a future source is simply unproven — all
three get the full core even when the profile changed. The switch note
says "every other rule from the already-injected core profile stays in
force", which is a lie the chair cannot detect if the core is gone.

TEAMMATE sessions are skipped entirely. Named agent-teams workers are
full claude sessions and fire SessionStart like the chair does — but the
profile is written for the chair alone: injected into a worker it says
"you are the ORCHESTRATOR" and invites it to spawn subagents, inverting
the very discipline the plugin enforces (measured in the wild: 172 of
270 injected sessions were teammates). Detection is the same ancestor
walk the stop guard uses (`--agent-id` on the nearest claude ancestor);
the session marker is still written so the other guards keep working.
FABLE_ORCH_TEAMMATE_INJECT=1 restores the old inject-everyone
behaviour.

The hook also maintains the per-session marker the Stop and SessionEnd
hooks rely on: its immutable `started` timestamp survives the re-runs
SessionStart gets on resume/clear/compact, and the stop guard compares
ledger mtimes against it to decide ownership.
