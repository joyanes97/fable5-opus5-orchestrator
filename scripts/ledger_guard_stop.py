"""Stop guard: hold a turn-end while the session's Requirements Ledger has open items.

Open item = a line matching '- [ ]'. Closed: '- [x]' (done+verified) or
'- [~] deferred: <reason>' (user-approved).

Blocking is SCOPED so the reminder doesn't tax every conversational turn
(measured in the wild: hundreds of per-turn blocks per project):

  1. OWNERSHIP — block only if the ledger was modified during THIS
     session. Session start is approximated by the mtime of the
     per-session model cache written by the SessionStart injector;
     without a cache (manual install), ownership is assumed.
  2. CADENCE — once per session per ledger. A sidecar file in the
     temp dir records the ledgers this session was already held on.

LEDGER_GUARD_STOP_MODE=every-turn restores the legacy per-turn blocking.

Any .workflow/LEDGER*.md counts (most recent wins; *-archive.md is
retired). It is searched from the working directory upward, stopping at
the first directory containing .git (a FILE in worktrees/submodules —
still a boundary) or at $HOME, so a ledger above the home directory can
never hold unrelated sessions.

Piggybacked duty: because this hook fires at every turn end of every
session, it also runs the rate-limited teammate-pane sweep (see
reap_idle_teammates) — finished teammates die within roughly
FABLE_ORCH_TEAMMATE_IDLE_H hours instead of waiting for a SessionEnd
that may be days away.
